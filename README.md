# Jack Kingsley - ECON 260 Final Project

#### QUESTION:

How does a salary cap affect a professional soccer club's optimal roster investment and profit?

#### VARIABLES:

Before setting up a model that can accurately represent a professional soccer club's roster investment choices and profit under a salary cap, I must first define several variables relating to the types of players the club signs (talent level), the wages these players earn, the salary cap in place, the revenue function, and the profit formula:

T = aggregate talent level of players

R(T) = revenue function

p = players' wage

C = salary cap

$\pi$ = R(T) - pT, s.t. $pT \le C$

#### ASSUMPTIONS:

This model simplifies various realities of the professional soccer industry in order to make the equations below as clear as possible:

Assumption #1: A single representative club's objective is to maximize short-run profit under the salary cap constraint (i.e. the salary cap constrains the club's payroll only during the current season)

Assumption #2: $T \ge 0$ (i.e. aggregate talent/quality within a roster cannot be negative in reality)

Assumption #3: $p > 0$, so total wage = pT (as implied by the salary cap, $pT \le C$)

Assumption #4: Match-related revenue is an increasing, concave function of talent (i.e. R = R(T))

Assumption #5: $R'(T) > 0$ and $R''(T) < 0$ (i.e. diminishing marginal returns of extra talent)

Assumption #6: Non-wage costs are ignored
